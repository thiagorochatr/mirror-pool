//! How many spends actually fit in one settlement, measured against the compiled
//! program.
//!
//! `settle_epoch` takes a count and reads three accounts per spend, and every
//! sentence in this repository that says "batch" is quietly assuming that count
//! can be large. Two unrelated things bound it: the 1232-byte packet a
//! transaction has to fit inside, and the compute budget the instruction runs
//! under. Only one of them binds, and which one it is changes what a settler
//! should do about it — ask for more compute, or send more transactions.
//!
//! So the number is taken rather than argued. Nothing below is extrapolated from
//! a smaller batch: the ceiling is found by settling real spends against the real
//! `.so` in litesvm, and both limits are reported at the answer.
//!
//! **This measures a *legacy* transaction, and that scoping is the whole
//! meaning of the number.** A legacy message names every account by its full 32
//! bytes, which is what makes a member cost ~99 bytes and what puts the wall at
//! ten. A v0 message may instead resolve accounts through an address lookup
//! table published on chain, at one byte per account — the packet then stops
//! binding entirely, and something else takes over. `crates/mirror-cli/src/
//! lookup.rs` is that path, and `mirror settle` takes it automatically for any
//! batch this test would refuse. Ten is the floor a settler gets with no setup
//! at all, not the most the program can do.
//!
//! Requires `make build-sbf` first, like the end-to-end suite. This is a
//! measurement of the deployed artefact, not of the host crate, so a missing
//! artefact says so rather than quietly measuring nothing.

//! What an action costs the crowd, measured against the compiled program.
//!
//! `batch_ceiling.rs` establishes that ten spends fit in one settlement and that
//! the 1232-byte packet, not compute, is what stops the eleventh. That number is
//! for plain transfers, where a spend brings exactly three accounts nobody else
//! shares: its record, its beneficiary and its relay. A spend whose action is a
//! CPI brings more — the callee's own program account, plus one slot per account
//! the action needs — so the ceiling for an action batch is lower, and until this
//! file nobody had taken it.
//!
//! The ceiling is not one number, because it is not a property of the action's
//! *shape* alone. Transaction size is driven by how many **distinct** keys the
//! message names, and two members delegating to the same validator name one vote
//! account between them while two members delegating to different validators name
//! two. So a batch whose members agree carries more members than a batch whose
//! members diverge: divergence in the content of an action is paid for in
//! anonymity-set size. That is the result this file is named for, and the two
//! stake batches below are settled for real rather than argued.
//!
//! Real means real. litesvm carries the Core BPF stake program, so a member's
//! `DelegateStake` here is executed by the actual stake program against a vote
//! account the actual vote program initialised, with the pool's vault signing as
//! the stake authority through `invoke_signed`. The batches settle, the stake
//! accounts end up delegated, and the compute the settlement consumed is
//! reported next to the bytes — because a size-only claim cannot say whether
//! compute also binds.
//!
//! Not every row is executed, and the table says which are. The two
//! stake-delegation rows — the result — are settled at their ceiling. The generic
//! curve around them (a call with k action accounts, shared between the members
//! or one each) is a size measurement and nothing more: it is taken from the
//! program's real instruction encoding rather than from arithmetic, but no batch
//! of that shape was run, so it is labelled `size only` and carries no compute
//! figure. The transfer row is the control: `batch_ceiling.rs` already settles it
//! against the same `.so`, so this file recomputing 10 spends / 1228 bytes is a
//! check on the encoder rather than a new claim. If that row ever moves, the
//! model of the wire here is wrong and every other number it prints is suspect.
//!
//! Requires `make build-sbf` first, like the rest of the on-chain suite.

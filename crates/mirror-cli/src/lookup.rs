//! Address lookup tables, as much of them as a settlement needs.
//!
//! A legacy transaction names every account it touches by its full 32 bytes, so
//! a batch of members costs about 99 bytes each and the 1232-byte packet stops
//! it at ten. A v0 transaction may instead name accounts by a one-byte index
//! into a table published on chain, which drops the marginal cost of a member by
//! more than an order of magnitude and moves the ceiling somewhere else
//! entirely. `batch_ceiling.rs` measures the legacy number; this module is how
//! settlement stops being bound by it.
//!
//! The instruction layouts belong to somebody else's program and are written out
//! here rather than pulled in as a dependency, for the same reason `stake.rs`
//! does it: the crate that owns them drags in half the SDK, and a byte layout
//! whose derivation is written down can be checked by a reader.
//!
//! **A table is not free and it is not private.** It is a rent-paying account
//! that lists, publicly and durably, every address the settlement will touch —
//! published *before* the settlement lands. That is a real disclosure, and the
//! answer to it is `deactivate` + `close`: the rent comes back and the list
//! stops existing. A design that creates one of these per batch and never closes
//! it leaves both the lamports and the list behind, permanently, once per round.

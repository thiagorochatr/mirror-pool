//! Different members, different validators, one timestamp.
//!
//! `PROOF.md` shows the pool delegating stake as a member's authority, once, in
//! a batch whose other members were making payments. That establishes the
//! capability and leaves the harder question open: a batch of *identical*
//! actions is the easy case for an anonymity set, because there is nothing to
//! tell the members apart in the first place. The question worth answering is
//! what happens when the actions **diverge in content** — when each member picks
//! a different validator, which is exactly the behavioural pattern that
//! fingerprints a staker across time.
//!
//! So this run settles N delegations to N *different* validators in one
//! transaction, and reads every stake account back off the cluster to check that
//! each member got the validator they asked for.
//!
//! It also measures what that costs, because it does cost something. A
//! transaction names each distinct account once, and a batch of divergent
//! actions names more distinct accounts than a batch of uniform ones — one extra
//! vote account per member. The 1232-byte packet is therefore reached sooner,
//! and **the anonymity set a divergent batch can hold is smaller than the one a
//! uniform batch can hold**. That is a real trade-off in the design and it is
//! better measured than left for a reader to discover.
//!
//! Nothing here is simulated. The ceiling is found by serializing real
//! instructions, and the batch at that ceiling is settled against a live
//! cluster.

         that runs out of compute is to ask for more with a `SetComputeUnitLimit` \
         instruction. Measured against this very batch, that instruction costs **{} \
         bytes**, and a full legacy settlement has {} to spare. In a legacy transaction, \
         raising the budget means dropping a member.\n\n\
         **A lookup table lifts that, and here is how far.** Naming accounts by one \
         byte each takes the packet out of the way — `mirror settle` does it \
         automatically, and a batch of twenty plain transfers settled that way on devnet \
         at 332 bytes of 1232. What takes over for *delegations* is the 64-account lock \
         limit, and it is a different kind of limit: bytes are spent naming an account, \
         locks are held per **distinct** account.\n\n\

         | all delegating to the same validator | {} | **{}** |\n\
         | each delegating to a different one | {} | **{}** |\n\n\
         A full divergent batch through a table holds {} of the 64 locks a transaction \
         may take. Both ceilings roughly double, and the gap between them widens from one \
         member to {} — because a shared vote account is named once either way but locked \
         only once too, so agreeing on a validator is worth more here than it was in the \
         packet.\n\n\
         **The compute budget instruction is counted in those two figures, because at \
         this size it is not optional.** A batch of {} delegations costs on the order of \
         {} CU at the per-member rate this run measured, well past the 200,000 a \
         transaction is given by default. Asking for more brings the compute-budget \
         program along, and a program is an account — so raising the budget still costs a \
         member. In the legacy packet that cost was {} bytes; through a table it is one \
         lock. The escape from one limit is paid out of the other in both regimes, which \
         is the finding rather than the inconvenience.\n\n\
         **What kind of number these two are.** They are computed the same way the packet \
         ceilings above are — by building the real instruction and counting what it \
         names — and not by settling a batch of that size. The 64-account limit itself is \
         not a guess: it was found on devnet, where 77 accounts returned \
         `TooManyAccountLocks`, and the twenty-transfer settlement cited above landed at \
         exactly 64. What has not been done is a delegation batch of {} settled through a \

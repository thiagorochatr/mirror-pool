//! Rebuilding a pool's state from the chain, with no index and no local file.
//!
//! The program stores the accumulator's *frontier* — one node per level — which
//! is all it needs to append a leaf and produce a root, and is not enough to
//! prove that any particular leaf is in the tree. A member needs the whole leaf
//! set for that.
//!
//! The leaves are not lost, though: every commitment was an argument to a
//! `Deposit` instruction, so the complete set is sitting in the transaction
//! history in the order it was inserted. This module reads it back.
//!
//! That matters beyond convenience. A client that depended on a local note
//! ledger would strand a member who lost the file, and one that depended on an
//! indexer would put a server between a member and their own money. Neither is
//! acceptable for a tool whose entire premise is that you should not have to
//! trust the operator — including us.

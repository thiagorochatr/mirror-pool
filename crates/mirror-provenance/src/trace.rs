//! Pass one: walk the birth-edge chain and record what was seen.
//!
//! The only networked step. Everything it observes is written to a sample file,
//! and pass two runs over that file with no network at all — so a published
//! number can be recomputed by anyone holding the sample, without RPC access and
//! without trusting that our endpoint behaved the same way on their machine.
//!
//! ## Why the oldest edge
//!
//! Funding is, by definition, among an address's *oldest* transactions.
//! `getSignaturesForAddress` returns newest-first with no forward cursor, so for
//! an address with fewer than one page of lifetime signatures the birth
//! transaction is the **last element of the first page**.
//!
//! Taking the first few entries of that page instead — the most **recent**
//! transactions — is the wrong end of the history for any address with more
//! than a page-fragment of activity. It also fails silently, reporting
//! "unresolved" where the truth is "we looked in the wrong place", and it does
//! so for exactly the active wallets a funding trace most wants to follow.
//!
//! ## Where pass one stops
//!
//! Only on rules that are properties of the address itself: it is a program or a
//! PDA, it has no incoming edge, the edge is too small, or the budget ran out.
//! The set-level rules wait for pass two, which sees the whole sample. Stopping
//! early on an address-local rule is safe because pass two would fire the same
//! rule at the same place; the recorded chain is always a superset of what pass
//! two needs.

//! Building a member-weighted frame from a pool's depositors.
//!
//! The frame decides what the measurement is *of*, and getting it wrong is the
//! easiest way to produce a confident number about the wrong population.
//!
//! **Member-weighted, not transaction-weighted.** Each depositor appears once
//! however often they transact. Sampling addresses because they appear in recent
//! blocks is size-biased: an address that transacts a thousand times a day is a
//! thousand times likelier to be drawn than one that transacts daily, so the
//! frame fills with market makers and bots. Our own first run did exactly this
//! and produced nothing; `docs/MEASUREMENT_LOG.md` records it.
//!
//! **Spread across the pool's history, not its last minute.** Pages are walked
//! backwards through the whole signature history and depositors are taken from
//! every page. A published measurement in this space draws its entire sample
//! from a nine-slot window — about four seconds of chain time — and reports
//! Wilson intervals over it as though it were an independent sample of a
//! population.
//!
//! **Nothing is excluded for being hard to trace.** Busy depositors stay in.
//! Dropping them would inflate the resolved fraction by construction, which is
//! the bias that makes a competing measurement's untraceable bucket look like a
//! finding about the pool.

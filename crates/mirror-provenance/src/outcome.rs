//! How a trace ends, and the census that keeps infrastructure limits from
//! reading as evidence.
//!
//! The governing principle: **an RPC failure is not a finding.** A rate-limited
//! call that returns nothing must never be recorded as "this address has no
//! funder", because that is indistinguishable in the output from a genuine
//! terminal — and it inflates exactly the bucket a privacy measurement most
//! wants to be large.
//!
//! A published tracer in this space uses `.unwrap_or(0)` for signature counts
//! and `.unwrap_or_default()` for signature lists. A throttled call there makes
//! an address look like it has zero history, so it is not detected as a hub and
//! is admitted to the sample, and a throttled trace yields no funder, so the
//! member is classified unresolved. Its large unresolved bucket is what
//! systematic rate limiting would manufacture, and its headline does not say so.

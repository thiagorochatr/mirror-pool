//! Poseidon over BN254, with domain separation by arity.
//!
//! `solana-poseidon` is the only entry point, deliberately. Upstream it is
//! cfg-gated to the `sol_poseidon` syscall on-chain and to light-poseidon over
//! ark-bn254 off-chain, so the host and the program compute the same function by
//! construction rather than by our own careful duplication. The R1CS gadget in
//! `mirror-circuit` is checked against this, which closes the three-way parity:
//! gadget == host == syscall.
//!
//! ## Domain separation
//!
//! Poseidon instances of different width are different permutations, so arity is
//! itself a domain separator — and it is a free one. Each hashed value in the
//! protocol uses a distinct arity, so no preimage of one can ever be reread as a
//! preimage of another:
//!
//! | value | arity | preimage |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | nullifier | 1 | `(k)` |
//! | Merkle node | 2 | `(left, right)` |
//! | note commitment | 3 | `(k, r, denom_tag)` |
//!
//! The action binding is not in this table: its payload is variable length, so
//! it is a keccak digest rather than a Poseidon compression. See
//! [`action_binding`].
//!
//! An explicit integer tag was the first design here and it was wrong: with a
//! small tag constant, a Merkle node whose left child equals the tag collides
//! with a nullifier. Reaching that state requires a Poseidon preimage and so is
//! not practically exploitable, but arity separation removes the question
//! entirely at no cost.
//!
//! Hashing Merkle nodes, nullifiers and action bindings with one untagged
//! arity-2 function is the shortcut this avoids: it works, right up until a
//! value from one domain is accepted where another was meant.
